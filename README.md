## Synopsis ##

Available Languagea retrieves the languages set in the Preferences panel when using the Language Redirect extension, highlighting the default one; you can now have this kind of information as an Event, without having to attach the Language Redirect Event to a page, avoiding said redirect. 

Heavily inspired by the LHandles extension by Vlad Ghita, and the Language Redirect by Jonas Coch, from whom I borrowed the languages names array :P Thanks both!

## Installation & Updating ##

Just enable the extension.

## Usage ##

Available Languages creates and Event, where the information about the languages is stored. Simply remember to attach such Event in the pages you might need this kind of information.
